# The Importance of Fitness and Health as a Developer

After the festive season of over indulgence and the start of another set of New Yearâ€™s resolutions - now is a good time to start thinking about your fitness and health. Especially as many of us developers sit behind our desks for extended periods of time. The talk will be fairly light hearted gentle encouragement to move more, eat a little better, get a little healthier and ultimately be better developers. Contains pseudo science, gut feelings, observations and hand drawn graphs.

Yeah, but sweet things taste nicer
- taste releases same brain chemicals as cocaine, nicotine and sex
- sugar bounce (graph!)
- fructose is sweet
  - your body doesn't use it
  - historically we consumed very little
  - just converts it to fat in your liver
  - clogs your liver, can clog arteries, deposits somewhere
- insulin is released, cells open to take in glucose, they won't accept fat
- fat then deposits, fructose fat deposits on your stomach (like me!)

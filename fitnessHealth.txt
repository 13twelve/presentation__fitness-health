# The Importance of Fitness and Health as a Developer

After the festive season of over indulgence and the start of another set of New Yearâ€™s resolutions * now is a good time to start thinking about your fitness and health. Especially as many of us developers sit behind our desks for extended periods of time. The talk will be fairly light hearted gentle encouragement to move more, eat a little better, get a little healthier and ultimately be better developers. Contains pseudo science, gut feelings, observations and hand drawn graphs.
